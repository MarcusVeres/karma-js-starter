### Starter project for lightweight JavaScript testing.

Want to run a few JavaScript tests without installing a 200MB framework, fiddling with config files, or trying to determine which of the 20 "assert-js" plugins is the right one to use? Try this!

### Running the Code

    npm install 
    npm test 

Add your own tests and start coding :)
